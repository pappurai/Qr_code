# QR code generator in Expo

This example uses two different QR code libraries that both work in Expo's Managed Workflow. In a real app you would of course only need one.

## react-native-qrcode-svg

Works on iOS, Android and Web.

### Installation

```
expo install react-native-svg react-native-qrcode-svg
```

## The react-native-custom-qr-codes-expo

This library does not work on Expo Web but works on iOS and Android.

### Installation

```
expo install react-native-svg react-native-custom-qr-codes-expo
```
